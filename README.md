# üîÑ RESTack API

**RESTack** is an experimental REST API developed exclusively for educational purposes.

There are some different operations that can be performed, such as a CRUD for users, and also the creation of projects. Furthermore, there are some rules for route access, e.g. only authenticated users can create, update and delete projects/users, but retrieving them is allowed for everyone.

Some other routes available are:

- **POST** @ _http://localhost:3000/project/_: Create a new project with `name`, `stack`

- **PUT** @ _http://localhost:3000/project/id_: Update an existing project by `id`

- **PUT** @ _http://localhost:3000/user/id_: Updata an existing user by `id`

- **DELETE** @ _http://localhost:3000/project/id_: Delete a project by `id`

- **DELETE** @ _http://localhost:3000/user/id_: Delete a user by `id`

<br/>

An important aspect of **RESTack** is the user authentication, necessary to perform some actions, such as create a project:
